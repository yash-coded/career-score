          I want you to generate a scorecard based on the given job description

          Any scorecard will have 3 fixed categories which will always be in a job category:
1. Employee work history prestige (ie on one extreme, Google is top tier, a local startup that has 2 employees and no revenue has none). Watch for people who claim to work for these companies but are joking, for example an uber driver saying they worked at Uber doing logistics technology. Weight this 20%.

2. Education history prestige (ie people who went to Harvard have maximum prestige in this category, but people who no education have minimum prestige in this category). Watch out for people who do free online courses and put this on their resume, prestige should only count for widely recognized programs that have a high barrier to entry / completion. Weight this at 20%.

3. Domain relavnce will amek up 10%. Domain relevance means understanding the problem the job posting is working in. For example, if I worked at Neo Financial, and wanted to get a job at RBC, I would have high domain relevance because we are both in banking and fintech. But, if I worked at Neo doing some arbitrary mapping tool which RBC does not have, it would have slight domain relevance, but not high domain relevance. The extremes are if I was doing something like oil and gas domain and airline software. However, something like oil and gas and emissions tracking software have medium to high domain relevance. This will be worth an additional 20% weight.

The rest of the scorecard will be made up of categories of perceived interest to the recruiter. For example, if the job asks for OOP and mentions multiple languages like Pyhton, Typescript, C++, but the applicant mentions Java experience demonstrating OOP terminology, still give them full points for this experience.
