        "feedback": "The resume demonstrates strong software development experience and full-stack capabilities, particularly with Node.js and TypeScript. However, it lacks specific mentions of experience with data structures and algorithms, as well as back-end languages like Java, Python, or Go. Additionally, there is no evidence of experience in performance analysis, debugging, or developing accessible technologies. These areas need to be addressed to align more closely with the job requirements.",

Add details about performance analysis and debugging experience. 4. If applicable, mention any work related to accessible technologies."
